Upon receving a new announcement one must add it to the cache.
All entries in a cache have expiration time.

ssdp:discover requests sent to the SSDP multicast channel/port MUST 
   have a request-URI of "*". Note that future specifications may allow 
   for other request-URIs to be used so implementations based on this 
   specification MUST be ready to ignore ssdp:discover requests on the 
   SSDP multicast channel/port with a request-URI other than "*". 
    
   Only SSDP services that have a service type that matches the value 
   in the ST header MAY respond to a ssdp:discover request on the SSDP 
   multicast channel/port. 
    
   Responses to ssdp:discover requests sent over the SSDP multicast 
   channel/port are to be sent to the IP address/port the ssdp:discover 
   request came from. 

Response to ssdp:discover requests SHOULD contain a cache-control: 
   max-age or Expires header. If both are present then they are to be 
   processed in the order specified by HTTP/1.1, that is, the cache-
   control header takes precedence of the Expires header. If neither 
   the cache-control nor the Expires header is provided on the response 
   to a ssdp:discover request then the information contained in that 
   response MUST NOT be cached by SSDP clients.
